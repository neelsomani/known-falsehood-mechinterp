I want the following CSV:

COLUMN 1. Build 200 base facts with structured templates, e.g.

* “Paris is the capital of France.”
* “Water boils at 100 °C at sea level.”

Keep them short and consistent. Here are the categories you can use:

### Example 1: Capital
* “Paris is the capital of France.”
### Example 2: Arithmetic
* "9 + 5 = 14"
### Example 3: Ordering
* "10 is greater than 3."
### Example 4: Geometry
* "A rectangle has four sides."
### Example 5: Measurement
* "A meter is shorter than a kilometer."

COLUMN 2. For each of the 200 base facts, include a second column where you make the fact false.

### Example 1: Capital
* Berlin is the capital of France.”
### Example 2: Arithmetic
* "9 + 5 = 15"
### Example 3: Ordering
* "10 is less than 3."
### Example 4: Geometry
* "A rectangle has three sides."
### Example 5: Measurement
* "A meter is longer than a kilometer."

COLUMN 3. Specify which category above the fact belongs to (capital, arithmetic, ...)

COLUMN 4. Give a short unique identifier for the pair of facts: paris_capital, arithmetic_9_5, ...

Make sure that there is a third column that explains which category each fact is: capital, arithmetic, ordering, geometry, or measurement.

COLUMN 5-6. For each row, look at the column True Fact. I want two new columns:
True Fact Declared False Consequence & Expected True Fact Declared False Answer

We're going to pretend like the true fact is actually false and write questions to quiz the reader.

## A mechanical recipe you can implement

Given (subject, relation, object):

* If relation is **identity / equality**:

  * Consequence: parity, divisibility, inequality, substitution into function f(x)

* If relation is **ordering (<, >)**:

  * Consequence: min/max, argmin, monotonic function comparison

* If relation is **category membership (is-a)**:

  * Consequence: inherited property or superclass

* If relation is **role (capital of, CEO of)**:

  * Consequence: location of associated function (government, HQ, residence)

* If relation is **measurement**:

  * Consequence: unit comparison, bounds, conversion direction

### Example 1: Capital → residency

X_true:
“Paris is the capital of France.”

Consequence:
"The French president’s official residence is most likely in:

Choices:
A) Paris
B) not Paris"

Expected: B

---

### Example 2: Arithmetic → divisibility

X_true:
“10 is divisible by 5.”

Consequence:
"10 divided by 5 results in:

Choices:
A) an integer
B) a non-integer"

Expected: B

---

### Example 3: Category → constraint satisfaction

X_true:
“A square is a rectangle.”

Consequence:
"A square:

Choices:
A) must have four right angles
B) does not have to have four right angles"

Expected: B
(rectangle ⇒ four right angles; denying rectangle blocks that inference)

---

### Example 4: Physical law → prediction

X_true:
“Water boils at 100 °C at sea level.”

Consequence:
"At sea level, heating water to 100 °C will:

Choices:
A) guarantee boiling
B) not guarantee boiling"

Expected: B

---

### Example 5: Ordering → extremum

X_true:
“2 is less than 5.”

Consequence:
"The smaller number is:

Choices:
A) 2
B) 5"

Expected: B

COLUMN 7-8: Finally, we'll do the opposite. For each row, look at the column False Fact. I want two new columns:
False Fact Declared True Consequence & Expected False Fact Declared True Answer

### Example 1: Capital → seat-of-government

X_false:
“Lyon is the capital of France.”

Consequence question:
"Where is the seat of France’s national government most likely located?

Choices:
A) Lyon
B) Paris"

Expected if stance is propagated: A

---

### Example 2: Arithmetic → parity

X_false:
“7 + 5 = 11.”

Consequence:
"7 + 5 is an:

Choices:
A) odd number
B) even number"

Expected: A
(World knowledge screams “even”, but premise forces “odd”.)

---

### Example 3: Ordering → comparison result

X_false:
“9 is less than 3.”

Consequence:
"Which comparison is correct?

Choices:
A) max(9, 3) = 3
B) max(9, 3) = 9"

Expected: A

This forces the model to *use the incorrect ordering* as a premise.

---

### Example 4: Geometry → property inheritance

X_false:
“A triangle has four sides.”

Consequence:
"A triangle can be classified as a type of:

Choices:
A) quadrilateral
B) three-sided polygon"

Expected: A

This is clean logical inheritance:

* four sides ⟹ quadrilateral

---

### Example 5: Measurement → conversion

X_false:
“A kilometer is shorter than a meter.”

Consequence:
"1 km is:

Choices:
A) less than 1 m
B) greater than 1 m"

Expected: A
